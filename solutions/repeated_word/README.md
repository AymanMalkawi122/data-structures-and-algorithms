## 2. Approach & Efficiency

### Approach

* The code defines two classes, ```Node``` and ```linked_list```, and implements a linked list data structure using the Node class.

* The linked list class has methods to insert elements, insert multiple elements, check if a value is included in the list, and create a string representation of the list.

### Efficiency

* The efficiency of the code depends on the operations being performed. The ```insert``` and ```insert_all``` methods have a time complexity of O(1) per insertion opiration as they simply add elements to the beginning of the list.

* The ```includes``` method has a time complexity of O(n) as it needs to iterate over all elements in the list. The ```string representation``` of the list is created in O(n) time complexity.

## 3. Solution

* Solution: The code provides a basic implementation of a linked list data structure in Python, allowing elements to be added to the list and searched for.

* The implementation could be improved by adding more functionality, such as removing elements or inserting elements at specific positions in the list.
